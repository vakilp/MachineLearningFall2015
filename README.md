# MachineLearningFall2015

This is a course on coursera.org. Can be found at: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

It is taught by Andrew Ng. The course runs from November 30 - February 22. The class assignments are written in MATLAB and
did use some toolboxes that I did not have access to. The class provided an academic license for these toolboxes.
